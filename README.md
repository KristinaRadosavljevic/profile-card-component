## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- Flexbox
- Animations

### What I learned

This was a pretty straightforward challenge as far as the layout was concerned, but I did struggle and experiment a lot with the background image. This gave me an opportunity to practice all the different `background` properties, and I also challenged myself a bit by adding some animations to the background.

In this process, I also discovered the power of using `vmax` and `vmin` units.
